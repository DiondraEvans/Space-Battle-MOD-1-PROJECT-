<h1>Technologies:</h1>
<p>I developed this project using HTML5 and JavaScript That could be played on the webpage or console. This is a functional battleship game utilizing basic knowledge
  of <b>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</b> principles to manipulate the DOM.</p>

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS HelloWorld, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.</p>
<p>Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers. There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical
and attack one at a timeâ€”they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship.</p>
<p>Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order.</p>
